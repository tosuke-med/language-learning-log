I saw the article from Nature.

There was a sentence like this.
[
  "Against this backdrop, the concept of AI co-scientist has gained momentum across scientific disciplines",
](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02487-6)

When I see "backdrop", I imagine wrestling technique because in Japan "backdrop" only means this way.
(Try Google "backdrop wrestling"!)

Anyway, in introduction section in a research article, we usually explains research background, and then tell the gap based on the background.
We need to have variations of these expressions such as:
In this context,
Given these development,...

LLM are really helpful to find those expressions. But, it sometimes provides uncommon phrases or words. I need to pay attention for that.
