I think that a language learning log is a good idea to build habits and to look back on your way of studying a language. Actually, after I started writing this log, I have continuously studied languages such as English and French. I also sometimes get feedback on my learning methods by myself.

I also share some ways to use large language models to create quizzes and create situations for learning phrases. These ideas are effective for me to some extent. If I want to try the same way again, I can look back on this log.

This log is on GitHub, so if I use Codex or other coding agent tools, I can easily review my prompts and also summarize how to use LLMs. For these reasons, the habit of writing a log is very helpful for me.
