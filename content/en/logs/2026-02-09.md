I sometimes take an online English lesson. And after the lesson, I can get the audio file of the conversation. At that time, Google NotebookLM is really useful because when I upload the audio file, it scans it and displays the transcript.

Even now, ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini can't do the same thing, but Google NotebookLM can. I could build a similar function using a programming language such as Python, but NotebookLM is much easier for everyone. You also need to be careful when uploading audio files that contain personal data.
