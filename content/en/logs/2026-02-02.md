On weekends, I review what I learned during the week and practice producing it again. I use the prompts I introduced this week, along with a few additional ones.

## Goal
Practice reusing idioms, expressions, and wording patterns from target English phrases through short, natural conversational exchanges, without seeing the phrases in advance.

## Initial Step
I will paste a list of phrases all at once.
Treat them as a hidden phrase pool.
Do not show, quote, number, or hint at the phrases during practice.

## Core Rules
- Select one hidden phrase per mini-conversation
- Focus on reusable parts of the phrase (idioms, collocations, framing), not the full sentence
- Prioritize natural conversational flow over phrase matching
- Never reveal the phrase before feedback

## Practice Flow (repeat for each hidden phrase)
### You
Present a natural conversational situation.

Act as the other speaker and respond naturally to me.
No model sentences. No example answers.

### Me
Respond in English (1 sentence).

### You
Reply as the conversation partner (1 sentence).

### Me
Respond again (1 sentence).<-- I don't need to use the expression here.

### You — Feedback
Provide two parts only:

**(a) Conversation feedback**
- Briefly evaluate the naturalness of the exchange
- Provide a clean revised version of my replies only

**(b) Expression-based feedback**
- Reveal the source phrase
- Explicitly point out the reusable part (idiom / structure / wording)
- Explain how it fits the conversation
- Give one short example line using that reusable part

I use these prompts for both speaking and writing, and I practice them across different types of stimuli. Each prompt is triggered by a situation—for example, when I want to say something, it is usually prompted by a stimulus such as a visual cue or a semantic context. In real communication, we use words in response to visual or conceptual stimuli, and this depends heavily on the situation.

Therefore, when practicing output in realistic situations, the most important thing is to connect the phrases we have learned to the appropriate stimuli. This linkage is essential for effective practice.

In English, I am roughly at the CEFR B2–C1 level, so I often use more abstract words and expressions. As a result, I need to practice output in more complex and nuanced situations. At the A1 level, for example, practice situations might include shopping or asking for directions—these are simple contexts where the range of phrases is largely predetermined. However, at higher levels, we need to expand phrases more flexibly, and much greater variation and abstraction are required.

LLMs are very helpful for learning phrases and words across multiple situations. Typically, when we learn a phrase, it is introduced in only one specific context, which makes it difficult to apply that phrase in other situations. In contrast, large language models can show how the same phrase is used in different contexts. This information is extremely useful for extending and generalizing our vocabulary.

In my prompts, when practicing a word or phrase, the LLM provides two different situations instead of just one. This allows me to practice using the same expression in more realistic and varied contexts.

This is an important way to use LLMs for language learning. Memorizing word meanings or translations is relatively easy with repetition, but producing language naturally in conversation is both the most important and the most difficult part of language learning. LLMs are particularly effective at supporting this kind of output-focused practice.
