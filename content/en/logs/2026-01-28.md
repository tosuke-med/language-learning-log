I have tried Gemini to create description quizzes to master English phrases. First, I put in the prompt below and let Gemini provide some styles of questions. 

"I’d like to learn the following English expressions through writing-based exercises. Could you suggest a few ways to structure the questions for me?"

Then, I choose the styles I want and practice with them.

I feel quizzes are helpful for using new phrases, but it is a little bit choppy because the phrases are not well categorized, since I provide phrases I have just come across in books and on websites. So next time, I want to try using categorized phrases.
