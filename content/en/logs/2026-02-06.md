News websites are really helpful for learning slightly specialized idioms and expressions in English. I usually read BBC News, and I came across a headline saying that the Trump administration seeks $1 billion in damages from Harvard University.

This title was a little confusing to me, because the meaning of “damages” was not very clear. I put this sentence into a large language model, and it explained that this expression refers to money being sought in a lawsuit. These kinds of legal terms are not often encountered in daily conversation. One good thing about using an LLM to learn a language is that it easily picks up on the context of idioms.

In that sense, news websites are a very good place to learn such expressions.
