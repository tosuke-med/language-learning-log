I am currently reading a book titled The Biomedical Writer. It is very helpful for understanding what kind of clarity is important in medical and research writing. While reading this type of writing guide, I realized something important: not all English articles are easy to understand or well written. 

As a language learner, I used to assume that English academic articles were always good models, but that is not necessarily true. Some papers are actually poor references when I try to write clear sentences. Therefore, once learners reach around the CEFR B2–C1 level, they need to judge whether a sentence is truly well written or simply difficult to read because it lacks clarity.
