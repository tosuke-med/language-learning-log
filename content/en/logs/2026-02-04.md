I have a terrible sore throat these days.
I usually use the recording and transcribing function on ChatGPT to write this log,
but it’s a little difficult this time.

Recently, I finished reading The Scientist’s Guide to Writing.
This is the best book on scientific writing I’ve ever read.

It mainly centers on the purpose of scientific writing and teaches us not only tips or techniques, but, more importantly, the core principles of scientific writing. I really love this style.

The experiences the author had are related to me. Maybe they are also related to every researcher.
