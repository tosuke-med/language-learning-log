Yesterday, I had a Zoom interview with a speaker. We talked about many technical things regarding medicine and research that I feel I couldn't fully grasp. I can understand the general overview of the information, but I always find it difficult to understand the logical relationships between the facts or the terminology.

This is my main concern when I talk with English speakers for work. I suspect that most of my cognitive resources are being used just to understand the meaning of the sentences. From now on, I’d like to try organizing the content of what I am listening to.

Gemini recommended that I draw visual maps while listening to discussions. I think this kind of practice will help improve my understanding. I'm a bit lazy, so I think I’ll just try doing it in my head.
