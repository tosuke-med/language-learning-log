Yesterday, I tried some description quizzes in English. My English is not very good, but it is at an intermediate level, so I practiced learning phrases and expressions and practicing how to use them more freely. I tried using generative AI to offer situation-based quizzes—for example, how to tell a junior undergraduate politely to correct a manuscript for a research article. This kind of situation quiz is very useful for practicing phrases in real situations, but it is a little bit tricky.

Because generative AI is really poor at providing a quiz without telling me the answer, I usually use a complicated prompt to achieve my purpose. I want to learn designated phrases by practicing them in real situations, but generative AI usually gives me the answer phrase to use before my answer. That is not good for practice. So now I use these prompts.

## Goal
Practice **recalling and using reusable key expressions and patterns** from target English phrases **naturally in context**, **without being shown the phrases in advance**.

## Initial Step
- I will paste a **list of phrases all at once**.
- Treat these phrases as a **hidden phrase pool**.
- **Do not**:
  - show  
  - number  
  - quote  
  - hint at  
  any of the phrases at this stage or during practice.

## Core Rules
- For each round:
  - Randomly select **one phrase internally** from the hidden pool.
  - Keep the selected phrase **completely hidden until feedback**.
- **Never reveal the phrase before my first answer**.
- My answer **does not need to reproduce the full phrase**.
- **Prioritize naturalness and communicative effectiveness** over phrase matching.

## Practice Flow  
*(Repeat for each hidden phrase)*

### 1. You
- Present **only a natural situation** where  
  some **part, pattern, or idea** from the hidden phrase could be used.
- **No model sentences**
- **No example answers**

### 2. Me
- I answer in English (**1–2 sentences**).

### 3. You — Feedback (TWO parts)

#### (a) General Feedback
- Evaluate how natural my answer is **on its own**.
- Provide a **revised version** of my answer.

#### (b) Expression-Based Feedback
- Explain which **key expression, structure, or wording pattern** from the hidden phrase could be useful in this situation.
- You **may reveal the full phrase here only as a source**, not as a memorization target.
- Explicitly point out the **reusable part**  
  (e.g. a clause, collocation, or framing).
- Provide **one example answer** that uses the reusable part  
  (not necessarily the full phrase).

### 4. You
- Present **another situation** where the **same reusable expression or pattern**
  (from the same hidden phrase) could be applied.
- **No model sentences**
- **No example answers**

### 5. Me
- I answer again.

### 6. You — Feedback
- Use the **same two-part format** as above.
### 7. Transition
- Move on to a **new hidden phrase**.
- Repeat the cycle.

If you want, you can use them with the phrases you want to learn. They can be good for practicing smooth output.
