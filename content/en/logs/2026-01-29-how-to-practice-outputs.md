Yesterday, I tried some description quizzes in English. My English is not very good, but it is at an intermediate level, so I practiced learning phrases and expressions and practicing how to use them more freely. I tried using generative AI to offer situation-based quizzes—for example, how to tell a junior undergraduate politely to correct a manuscript for a research article. This kind of situation quiz is very useful for practicing phrases in real situations, but it is a little bit tricky.

Because generative AI is really poor at providing a quiz without telling me the answer, I usually use a complicated prompt to achieve my purpose. I want to learn designated phrases by practicing them in real situations, but generative AI usually gives me the answer phrase to use before my answer. That is not good for practice. So now I use these prompts.

## English Phrase Recall Practice Prompt

### Goal
Practice recalling and using target English phrases naturally in context, without being shown the phrases in advance.

---

### Initial Step
- I will paste a list of phrases **all at once**.
- Treat the pasted phrases as a **hidden phrase pool**.
- **Do not** show, number, quote, paraphrase, or hint at the phrases at this stage or during practice.

---

### Core Rules
- For each round, **randomly select one phrase internally** from the hidden pool.
- Keep the selected phrase **completely hidden** until feedback.
- **Never reveal the phrase before my first answer**.
- **Do not prioritize the phrase over overall naturalness** of my response.

---

### Practice Flow (repeat for each phrase)

1. **You**  
   Present **only a natural situation** where the hidden phrase could be used.  
   - No model sentences.  
   - No example answers.

2. **Me**  
   I answer in English (1–2 sentences).

3. **You — Feedback (TWO parts)**  
   **(a) General feedback**  
   - Evaluate how natural my answer is on its own.  
   - Provide a **revised version** of my answer.

   **(b) Phrase-based feedback**  
   - Explain how the selected phrase could be used in this situation.  
   - You **may reveal the phrase here**.  
   - Provide **one example answer** using the phrase.

4. **You**  
   Present **another situation** using the **same hidden phrase** (still hidden).  
   - No model sentences.  
   - No example answers.

5. **Me**  
   I answer again.

6. **You — Feedback (same two-part format as above)**

7. **You**  
   Move on to a **new hidden phrase** and repeat the cycle.
