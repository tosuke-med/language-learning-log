I’m reading a novel titled The Answer Is No on Kindle. I had never used Kindle for reading novels before. With Kindle, I can use the highlight function, and later, on the web, I can review and check all the highlighted sections after reading.

I don’t like looking up words in a dictionary or on the web while reading, because it interrupts the flow of the story. That’s why I really like this Kindle feature. You can put those highlighted sections into generative AI, and then get advice on new words, phrases, or expressions that are a bit hard to understand.

In a novel, you can learn expressions used in day-to-day life, and this is very helpful. For example, I came across the expression “one flight of stairs.” I actually know many English words, but I didn’t know how to describe a short set of stairs like this.

These kinds of everyday words are sometimes surprisingly hard for language learners to know. When they face a situation where they want to use such words, that is often the moment they first realize that they don’t know the expression they actually need.
