J'ai mal à la gorge et j'ai mal à la tête. 

I have a sore throat this week. Positively thinking, this is a very good chance to learn these French words because cold is really obsessive for me. I don't want to think about that, but I think that again and again results in tension. So when I feel the sore throat pain, I recall these French words. This is very effective.
