Yesterday, I used Gemini to output French in different modes. When I asked Gemini that I would like to try some output, it suggested five output modes. These were the suggestions from Gemini.

The "Reverse Translation" Flashcard Method
Micro-Dialogue Scripting
"The Director" Exercise (Visual Output)
Voice-to-Text Shadowing
Selective Substitution (The "A1+" Hack)

I heard that translating a language is not very good for learning a new language because it just connects the new language to another language, which is not a natural circuit to use when you speak the new language.

I tried to recall the phrases I learned:

Je peux parler français. J’ai besoin de temps. C’est tellement bien.

Then, I have noticed even if I answer the quizzes correctly, it's challenging to recall the phrases without any cues.
