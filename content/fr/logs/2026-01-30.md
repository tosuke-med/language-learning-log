When I learn French, at some point it feels much more difficult than learning English. Even in Japan, I have many opportunities to read and write English because I’m a researcher. I sometimes write research articles, and I often read papers written in English.

However, French is not usually used in these materials, so I rarely have opportunities to use French in real situations. Against this background, I need to keep my interest in learning French, and therefore the learning materials themselves have to be interesting for me.

I’ve watched many YouTube videos, but a lot of beginner-level content is not very engaging. It is simple, but not intellectually interesting, so it’s hard to enjoy. That said, there are some videos I really like. My favorites are Easy French and Lou. Lou is a French anime about a young girl living in Paris. It’s very useful for learning natural expressions used in daily life, and it’s also good for practicing listening.

So I stick to these channels and try to pick up useful and simple expressions from them.
