These days, I’ve learned some phrases to use at the boulangerie.

— Je voudrais une baguette, s’il vous plaît.
— Vous voulez autre chose avec ça ?
— Ça fait vingt euros.
— Voilà. Merci beaucoup.

For these kinds of predetermined phrases used in specific situations, role-playing with an LLM is very useful. Creating a comic scene with an LLM is also both helpful and enjoyable.

For example, I asked an LLM—specifically Gemini—to create a comic scene set in a boulangerie. The result was very fun, and it made the phrases much easier to memorize thanks to the visual stimuli.

I also create versions of the comic with blank speech bubbles so that I can actively practice recalling the words and phrases using the picture.

When you look at a comic scene or a comic strip, you can naturally imagine what the characters want to say or what they are saying. This makes it an effective way to practice output in a specific situation. Using prompts like this allows for more realistic and engaging language practice.
