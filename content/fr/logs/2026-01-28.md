Today I used an app called CapWords. This app was one of the best apps of 2025.

It is very innovative and fascinating. The app allows you to capture images around you, such as clothes, utensils, dishes, and electrical appliances. When you want to learn a second language, the app provides translated words using the pictures you take. It is just like stickers. You take a picture of something around you and get the words for those things, like collecting stickers.

It is a lot of fun and a very intuitive way to learn new words, especially nouns. I use it for learning French, and so far I have enjoyed it. The app, of course, uses AI to recognize the pictures and create example sentences to show how to use the words. You can also test your pronunciation with daily quizzes.

Par exemple, j’ai pratiqué le pull, le panier, l'œuf en chocolat, les tartines de pain et les spaghetti aux crevettes.

The good point of this app is that when you see things around you, it reminds you of the words you have learned. So you can recall them many times. It is really helpful for memorizing words without any extra effort.
