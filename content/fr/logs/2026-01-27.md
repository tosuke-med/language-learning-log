From today I wrote a log of learning French at A1 level.

I watched my favorite YouTube channel “Easy French.”

I collected phrases in the video , and put the phrases into Gemini (Google AI) with prompts:

"Act as an expert French language tutor. Create an interactive multiple-choice quiz based on the following phrases: [Insert Phrases Here].
Requirements:
Level: Target A1 (Beginner) level learners.
Format: Use a fill-in-the-blank style for the questions.
Language: The questions must be in French, but the instructions, hints, and explanations for why an answer is correct or incorrect must be in English.
Structure: For each question, provide:
The question with a blank (e.g., '_____').
4 options.
A 'Hint' that helps the user think in the right direction.
A 'Rationale' for every option (explaining why it works or why it is a common mistake)."

I recommend Gemini and Google Notebook LM as a generative AI for language learning because it focus on learning by creating interactive quizzes easily. It helps us better than Chat GPT and Claude.

Today I learned "en" meaning "made of."
Une table en bois (An wooden table)
Une porte en fer (An iron door)

And, how to use "tellement"
C'est tellement lourd. (It's so heavy)
Il y a tellement de monde. (There are so many people)
