J'ai commencé à lire Le Petit Prince.
J'adore ce livre.  

It's a little bit hard to read though it's written with simple words and phrases.
But, it is fun to read the novel I've already know.

When I have a question about French words, I ask an LLM and memorize the phrases.
In that case, I focus on easy and understandable phrases, because if I try to memorize all the phrases I don’t know, it quickly becomes too much.
Even focusing on just a few phrases is helpful for expanding my vocabulary.
